# BookBot

BookBot is a small Python project that analyzes text files and produces simple statistics about their contents. It’s a great little tool for exploring word counts, character frequencies, and other basic text‑processing tasks.

## Features

- Count total words in a text file
- Count total characters
- Generate frequency statistics for each character
- Process multiple books stored in the `books/` directory
- Clean, readable output

## Requirements
BookBot uses only the Python standard library — no external dependencies required.

## Contributing
